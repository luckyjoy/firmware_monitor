üíª Firmware Monitor
This repository, luckyjoy/firmware_monitor, houses a solution for monitoring, analyzing, or tracking changes within firmware images. This document provides instructions for setting up the project locally, utilizing Docker for consistent deployment, and configuring Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using both GitHub Actions and Jenkins.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the project locally or build the Docker image, you will need:

Python 3.x (Required)

Docker (Required for containerization)

Git

Local Development
Download/Clone the repository:

The source code for this project can be downloaded directly from the GitHub repository page or cloned using Git.

Repository Link (Download Source): https://github.com/luckyjoy/firmware_monitor.git

git clone [https://github.com/luckyjoy/firmware_monitor.git](https://github.com/luckyjoy/firmware_monitor.git)
cd firmware_monitor





Run the monitor:

Execute the main script directly. This generates the analysis reports in the reports/ directory.

python firmware_monitor.py





üìä Monitored Features and Metrics
The analysis tool processes structured log data to provide comprehensive reports across core system domains:

Core Performance & Stability
CPU Usage (%): Tracks average and peak processing load.

Memory Footprint (kB): Monitors memory consumption to identify leaks or unexpected spikes.

Task Latency (Œºs): Measures task execution delay, reporting average, peak, and P95 (95th percentile) latency.

Boot Time (s): Calculates the total duration from system initialization to peripheral readiness.

Thermal & Power Management
Power Consumption (mW): Tracks power usage, including average and peak draw.

Temperature (C): Monitors thermal data to identify overheating or thermal spikes.

Operational Modes & Security
Boost Cycle Time (s): Measures the total duration the firmware spends in the high-performance 'BOOST' mode.

Security Events: Reports on critical incidents like failed authentication attempts and the current security state of the device.

üê≥ Docker Support
Using Docker ensures that the monitoring environment is consistent across development, testing, and production, avoiding "works on my machine" issues.

1. Build the Docker Image
Build the container image and tag it locally. Replace v1.0.0 with your desired version tag.

docker build -t firmware-monitor:v1.0.0 .





2. Run the Container
You can run the container locally, mapping necessary ports or volumes (e.g., if you need to access a local firmware file or database connection).

Example Run (Basic):

docker run --name fm_instance firmware-monitor:v1.0.0





Example Run (With Volume Mapping for Output Reports):
The script outputs reports to the /app/reports directory inside the container.

docker run -d \
    --name fm_production \
    -v $(pwd)/local_reports:/app/reports \
    firmware-monitor:v1.0.0





3. Push to Registry (Optional)
After testing, you can push the image to a container registry like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

# Tag for registry
docker tag firmware-monitor:v1.0.0 luckyjoy/firmware-monitor:v1.0.0

# Log in (if necessary)
# docker login

# Push the image
docker push luckyjoy/firmware-monitor:v1.0.0





‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Workflows
1. GitHub Actions
The GitHub Actions workflow automates testing and container image building directly within the GitHub environment on every push to the main branch or on every pull request.

File Location: .github/workflows/ci.yml

This workflow performs basic checks and builds the Docker image.

name: CI Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build_and_test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    - name: Run Analysis Script
      # Execute the self-contained script to verify functionality and generate reports
      run: python firmware_monitor.py

    - name: Log in to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
      if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      uses: docker/login-action@v3
      with:
        registry: ghcr.io
        username: ${{ github.actor }}
        password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

    - name: Build and push Docker image
      if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
      with:
        context: .
        push: true
        tags: |
          ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:latest
          ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}





2. Jenkins Pipeline (Declarative)
A Jenkins Declarative Pipeline is defined in a file named Jenkinsfile and allows Jenkins to automatically manage the CI/CD process.

File Location: Jenkinsfile (in the root of the repository)

This pipeline outlines the stages for testing and containerization.

pipeline {
    agent { docker { image 'python:3.10-slim' } }

    environment {
        DOCKER_IMAGE = "firmware-monitor:${BUILD_ID}"
        REGISTRY_URL = "[your-private-registry.com/firmware-monitor](https://your-private-registry.com/firmware-monitor)"
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                # Automatically handled by Jenkins SCM polling/webhooks
                echo 'Code checked out from SCM.'
            }
        }
        stage('Run Analysis') {
            steps {
                sh 'python firmware_monitor.py'
            }
        }
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh "docker build -t ${DOCKER_IMAGE} ."
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Publish Image') {
            when { expression { return env.BRANCH_NAME == 'main' } }
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'docker-registry-creds', passwordVariable: 'DOCKER_PASS', usernameVariable: 'DOCKER_USER')]) {
                    sh "docker tag ${DOCKER_IMAGE} ${REGISTRY_URL}:latest"
                    sh "docker login ${REGISTRY_URL} -u ${DOCKER_USER} -p ${DOCKER_PASS}"
                    sh "docker push ${REGISTRY_URL}:latest"
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy (Example)') {
            when { expression { return env.BRANCH_NAME == 'main' } }
            steps {
                echo "Deployment step for ${REGISTRY_URL}:latest"
                # Add steps here to trigger a Kubernetes deployment, Ansible playbook, etc.
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            echo 'Pipeline finished.'
            sh 'docker rmi -f ${DOCKER_IMAGE}' // Cleanup
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed. Check logs for details.'
        }
    }
}
